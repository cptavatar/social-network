social-network
==============

Clojure crawler to build a network of twitter users in neo4j based on a seed of dealer data. 

I currently work with automotive dealers and social networks. This is a side project to be able to load up 
the network of twitter followers / friends into a classic social graph to explore for interesting trends. 

 
This is missing data you'll need to run it as-is. You'll need both seed dealer account data and twitter account(s).
